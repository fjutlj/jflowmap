
Thanks for your interest in JFlowMap! 

To run the tool from the command line you need a view configuration file. 
You can find quite a few of them in the 'viewconf' folder. 

For example, to open the refugee dataset in the Flowstrates view type:
java -jar jflowmap.jar viewconf/refugees-flowstrates.jfmv
