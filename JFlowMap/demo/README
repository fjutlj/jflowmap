
Thanks for your interest in JFlowMap! 

There are two ways to run the app: 
  
  1) Simply open demo-applets.html in a browser (requires Java browser plugin);

  2) Run the tool from the command line.  

To run the tool from the command line you need to choose or create a view
configuration file. There are quite a few of them in the 'viewconf' folder
of this distribution. 

For example, to open the refugee dataset in the Flowstrates view type the
following in a UNIX terminal or in the Command Prompt in Windows:

  java -jar jflowmap.jar viewconf/refugees-flowstrates.jfmv  


To open it in the fullscreen mode type:

  java -jar jflowmap.jar -fullscreen viewconf/refugees-flowstrates.jfmv
