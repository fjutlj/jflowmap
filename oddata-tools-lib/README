oddata-tools provide a set of utilities for working with Origin-Destination data (i.e. data representing flows entitites, e.g. flows of people, animals, money,
material, or network traffic, between pairs of geographical locations).

Here is the list of currently supported tasks:
- Convert CSV to GraphML
- Augment the geographical locations with lat/lon coordinates (by querying geonames.org)
